Simple Control of Versions (SCV)
================================

The SCV is a tool that every terran player absolutely must use
to have a stable and diverse code-base.

It's equipped with various tools such as Fusion cutters and is able to gather all types of resources (Blue/yellow minerals and Vespene gas).
